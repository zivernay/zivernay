# Hi, I'm Zivanai! 👋

I'm a developer-in-training with a background in engineering. I am interested in:
- automating usually repetitive and tedious processes, especially in niche workflows where such applications do not exist. My journey with code started with simple data analysis and math modeling in Python. Now I test retail trading strategies using MQL5 by automating indicators and various trading strategies through Expert Advisors(EAs), and I am expanding into full stack web development with JavaScript because I would like to develop or work on applications with a full backend end and fontend.

![Zivanai's Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=zivernay&theme=vue-dark&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&count_private=true)


I'd say I am an aspiring full-stack developer with an engineering background and a passion for: automating boring stuff especially repetive workflows or tasks; analytics like timeseries analysis and data visualization; as well as just building practical solutions to various problems.

- 🔭 I am currently learning full stack web development through The Odin Project (JavaScript, Node.js, React).
- 🛠️ I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including advanced concepts), Python, and MQL5 (MetaQuotes Language for trading automation).
- 📈 I automated and tested retail trading strategies in MQL, including market structure and momentum detection using fractals, zigzag indicators, and statistical analysis.
- 🎮 I built interactive practice web apps and games in vanilla JS, such as [Etch-a-Sketch](https://github.com/zivernay/etch-a-sketch), [To-Do App](https://github.com/zivernay/todo-app), [Restaurant App](https://github.com/zivernay/restaurant-app), [Book Library Manager](https://github.com/zivernay/book-library), [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/zivernay/tic-tac-toe), [Calculator](https://github.com/zivernay/calculator), and [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/zivernay/rps-game).
- 🕵️‍♂️ I developed a [Python CLI price scraper](https://github.com/zivernay/scrapping) using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to simplify pricing in quantity surveying.
- 👨‍🎓 My engineering background provides strong analytical, problem-solving, and project planning skills, plus the ability to research and learn independently as well as apply discipline-specific knowledge when necessary.
